      the next stage. There are ten (10) stages. the 10th and final stage are for those who become the HNG's finalist.<br/> the only thing we promise is that we
      are going to give you a very nice T-Shirt, but normally good things happen to the finalist. You are now in the LMS meaning<br/> this is the place
      we are going to see different tasks that you would normally get, you can have the selected task that you wanna do,<br/> once you have selected the track you can
